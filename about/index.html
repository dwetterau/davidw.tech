                I recently graduated from the Turing Scholar Honors Program at the
                University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science.
                At the end of my senior year, I wrote an honors thesis on 
                <a href="http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/tech_reports/reports/tr/TR-2194.pdf">
                  communicating repicated state machines</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy building systems and websites that solve problems in people's everyday
                lives. As a software engineering intern, I have worked at Dropbox, Google, and Indeed.
                In the summer of 2015, I will begin working full-time as a Software Engineer
                at Dropbox in San Francisco, California. When I'm not programming, I enjoy rock
                climbing, playing video games, and playing ultimate frisbee.
