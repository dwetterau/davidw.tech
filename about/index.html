                I recently graduated from the Turing Scholar Honors Program at the
                University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science. I am currently a
                Software Engineer at Dropbox in San Francisco, California.
                At the end of my senior year of college, I wrote an honors thesis on
                "<a href="http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/tech_reports/reports/tr/TR-2194.pdf">
                Communicating Replicated State Machines</a>".
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy building systems and websites that solve problems in people's everyday
                lives. As a software engineering intern, I have worked at Dropbox, Google, and Indeed.
                When I'm not programming, I enjoy rock climbing, running, playing video games, and
                playing ultimate frisbee.
