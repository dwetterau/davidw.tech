                I was preparing for an interview with <a href="http://www.imgur.com">Imgur</a> in my senior year of
                college and one thing I decided to do was familiarize myself with the technologies they said they used
                on their public blog. I went about this by trying to implement as much as Imgur as I could and I got
                pretty far (except I ended up using node.js instead of PHP). The application I made was a node app
                written in Coffeescript that uses MySQL (with an ORM), Redis for image ranking, and nginx.

                At one point, my friends at school wanted to try using it so I started hosting it on my tiny
                DigitalOcean instance and let them use it and help me refine it. The live website itself can be found
                at the link above and of course all of the code can be found on Github.

                I have always enjoyed physics and the math behind it so when I learned to program, some of the first
                things I made were physics simulations. This is probably the fourth or fifth one
                I made but it was the first to include many complex collisions in 3 dimensions.
            <br /><br />
                My parents gave me a fantastic book on how to implement a commercial physics engine one Christmas and
                after reading through it, I decided to implement a physics engine like the one the author described in
                Javascript leveraging WebGL libraries for rendering. While implementing this engine, I actually found
                some errata in the book and <a href="https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics/pull/26">corrected
                them</a> in the author's open source C++ implementation. Some small demos of the engine working can be
                seen at the link above and all of the code is available on GitHub.

                My college roommates and I built what we eventually called "Dwopbox" during HackTX 2013. We were
                surprisingly successful during the hackathon and actually
                <a href="http://techzette.com/2013-hacktx-winners-and-finalists/">won the "Hacker Lounge" prize </a>
                for this project. Dwopbox is a peer-to-peer file sharing system written entirely in Javascript that
                uses WebRTC channels to transmit files.
            <br /><br />
                We built Dwopbox in the midst of many of Edward Snowden's NSA revelations which inspired us to think of
                a new way to share files across the Internet without the contents of the files themselves getting into
                the hands of a government. Dwopbox consisted of two parts, a simple Postgres database that stored file
                metadata, and a distributed protocol we created (essentially a simplified version of BitTorrent). The
                protocol allows users who joined a "room" to receive information about the files that the original user
                was sending. Using Chrome's local storage support, we first loaded the chosen files into the
                broadcaster's web browser, then started sending pieces of the file to other web browsers through WebRTC
                data channels. Once a viewer has all parts of the file, some client-side Javascript reconstructs the
                file by pulling it out of local storage and immediately "downloading" it to the device.
            <br /><br />
                The friends I worked on this project with were Calvin MacKenzie, Josh Slocum, Dan Rutledge, and
                Adam Faulkner.

                I implemented a 2-dimensional bouncing ball simulation to experiment with Javascript's access to device
                accelerometer data and the math behind momentum based glancing collisions. It was a lot of fun to derive
                the math behind elastic collisions that aren't head on. One interesting result of this was a almost
                labyrinth-style simulation on mobile devices (and some MacBook Pros). You can see the working simulation
                at the link above and the source code is hosted on GitHub.
