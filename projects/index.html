                I have always enjoyed physics and the math behind it so when I learned to program, some of the first
                things I made were physics simulations. This is probably the fourth or fifth one
                I made but it was the first to include many complex collisions in 3 dimensions.
            <br /><br />
                My parents gave me a fantastic book on how to implement a commercial physics engine one Christmas and
                after reading through it, I decided to implement a physics engine like the one the author described in
                Javascript leveraging WebGL libraries for rendering. While implementing this engine, I actually found
                some errata in the book and <a href="https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics/pull/26">corrected
                them</a> in the author's open source C++ implementation. Some small demos of the engine working can be
                seen at the link above and all of the code is available on
                <a href="https://github.com/dwetterau/JSPhysics">GitHub</a>.

                I implemented a 2-dimensional bouncing ball simulation to experiment with Javascript's access to device
                accelerometer data and the math behind momentum based glancing collisions. It was a lot of fun to derive
                the math behind elastic collisions that aren't head on. One interesting result of this was a almost
                labyrinth-style simulation on mobile devices (and some MacBook Pros). You can see the working simulation
                at the link above and the source code is hosted on
                <a href="https://github.com/dwetterau/JSPhysics/tree/master/legacy">GitHub</a>.
