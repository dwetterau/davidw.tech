                I was preparing for an interview with <a href="http://www.imgur.com">Imgur</a> in my senior year of
                college and one thing I decided to do was familiarize myself with the technologies they said they used
                on their public blog. I went about this by trying to implement as much as Imgur as I could and I got
                pretty far (except I ended up using node.js instead of PHP). The application I made was a node app
                written in Coffeescript that uses MySQL (with an ORM), Redis for image ranking, and nginx.

                At one point, my friends at school wanted to try using it so I started hosting it on my tiny
                DigitalOcean instance and let them use it and help me refine it. The live website itself can be found
                at the link above and of course all of the code can be found on Github.

                I have always enjoyed physics and the math behind it so when I learned to program, some of the first
                things I made were physics simulations. This is probably the fourth or fifth one
                I made but it was the first to include many complex collisions in 3 dimensions.
            <br /><br />
                My parents gave me a fantastic book on how to implement a commercial physics engine one Christmas and
                after reading through it, I decided to implement a physics engine like the one the author described in
                Javascript leveraging WebGL libraries for rendering. While implementing this engine, I actually found
                some errata in the book and <a href="https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics/pull/26">corrected
                them</a> in the author's open source C++ implementation. Some small demos of the engine working can be
                seen at the link above and all of the code is available on GitHub.

                I implemented a 2-dimensional bouncing ball simulation to experiment with Javascript's access to device
                accelerometer data and the math behind momentum based glancing collisions. It was a lot of fun to derive
                the math behind elastic collisions that aren't head on. One interesting result of this was a almost
                labyrinth-style simulation on mobile devices (and some MacBook Pros). You can see the working simulation
                at the link above and the source code is hosted on GitHub.
